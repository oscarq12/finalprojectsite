		I'm an experienced personal trainer who is prior service with the US Marines and with several years in training and nutrition, who has taken on many challenges of coaching/training multiple types of athletes as well as NPC and WBFF competitors. I help with all your needs of understanding fitness and competition preparations. I have successfully coached not only your average Joe, but also military service members. I'm a 2x NQ Men's Physique competitor in the NPC and without a doubt will give you the same effort I have given myself for my own preparations and transformations!
